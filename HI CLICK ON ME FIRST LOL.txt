yo whats up


what i have rn is basically the entire conversation part of the game. I haven't added decision weights to create the story tree/outcome yet, but I can do that later and it wont take too long

other than waiting for assets from the art team, I think the main thing that we have left to do is 

a) change the appearance of the text boxes to whatever you want lmao and

b) actually build the dressup part which is def the hardest section for sure.

regardless, I learned the basics of what I just did off that one yt video I found earlier and it was p helpful so if you have any questions lmk

also I comment my code a lot so hopefully what I did makes sense. the one thing that's kinda wierd is that all of my code is under the sprites label which is a bit shit organization-wise so I just need to fix that later lol


gl!
